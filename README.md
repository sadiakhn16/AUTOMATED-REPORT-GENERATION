*In this task, I created a Python script that reads data from a CSV file, calculates the total sales and product-wise sales, and then creates a nicely formatted PDF report. I used the FPDF library to design the report. The whole project was done in VS Code, and the final PDF gives a clear summary of all sales and transactions in a simple format.*
